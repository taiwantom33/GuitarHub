This is Tom Richter's Project0 for CS50 taught through EDX.
This is a repository for guitar knowledge that I've accumulated as I've gone about learning the guitar. I have split the website into four main pages:

Index.html - This is the homepage and simply contains a header and an unordered list containing links to the specific topics I want to keep track of.
Requirements fulfilled: Unordered List. Link to other webpages


Songs.html - This webpage contains two tables and no stylesheet. It is simply a table for songs that I've learned and a table for songs that I plan to learn. The second table also contains links to videos where I can learn the songs.
Requirements fulfilled: At least one table. Link to other webpages

Chords.html/Chords.css - This page is more advanced. I plan to use this page to actively show users how to play chords when they hit certain buttons. Right now it is the fretboard of a guitar up to 11 frets and has some interactivity.

Requirements Met:
Stylesheet, 5+ CSS properties, 5 CSS Selectors (#Id,.Class," ",:,>)
Bootstrap Component(Alert), 2+ Bootstrap columns

Scales.html/Scales.css/Scales.scss - This website gives the 5 forms of the pentatonic scale and the minor blues scale. This contains two images that will disappear if the screen is too small and just display the scale formula.

Requirements Met: Scss Variable, Scss inheritance, Scss nesting, image, media responsiveness
